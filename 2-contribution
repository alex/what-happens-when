When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, 
a complex chain of events takes place behind the scenes to ensure that you can access the Google search engine. 
Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

- Step 1: DNS Request
The first thing your browser does is send a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP address. 
The DNS server responds with the IP address of the load balancer that is responsible for routing the request to the appropriate web server.

- Step 2: TCP/IP Connection
Once your browser has the IP address of the load balancer, it initiates a TCP/IP connection to the load balancer. 
TCP/IP is a protocol that breaks the data into packets and sends them over the internet. 
The load balancer receives the request and forwards it to one of several web servers running the Google search engine.

- Step 3: HTTPS/SSL Handshake
If you are accessing a website that uses HTTPS, like Google, your browser initiates an HTTPS/SSL handshake with the web server to establish a secure connection. 
The SSL handshake involves exchanging cryptographic keys to ensure that the data you send and receive is encrypted and can't be intercepted by third parties.

- Step 4: Load Balancer Routing
The load balancer, which distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers, 
checks the request and routes it to the appropriate web server based on a pre-determined set of rules, such as server availability, 
response times, and geographic location.

- Step 5: Firewall and Web Server
The web server that receives the request processes it by checking if it is authorized to access the Google search engine. 
If the request passes the authorization check, the web server sends the request to the application server for further processing. 
Before that, it may also pass through a firewall which examines the traffic and blocks any suspicious or unauthorized requests.

- Step 6: Application Server and Database
The application server processes the request and queries the Google search engine's database to retrieve relevant search results. 
The application server also generates dynamic content and executes scripts to create the final page that is sent back to your browser.

- Step 7: Sending HTTP Response
The web server then sends an HTTP response to your browser with the requested information, including the search results, in the form of HTML code.
Your browser receives this response and begins to render the webpage, interpreting the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that make up the page.

In conclusion, accessing a website like Google involves a complex set of steps that utilize various technologies, including DNS requests, TCP/IP, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, firewalls, web servers, application servers, and databases. By understanding how these processes work, you can appreciate the intricate workings of the internet and the si
