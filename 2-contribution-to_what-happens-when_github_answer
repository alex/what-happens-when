# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter
When you type "google.com" into your web browser and press Enter, the following sequence of events occurs:
1. The browser sends a request to the domain name system (DNS) to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP address.
2. The DNS server looks up the IP address for the domain and returns it to the browser.
3. The browser sends a request to the web server at the IP address specified, asking for the content located at the root (/) of the domain.
4. The web server at the specified IP address receives the request and retrieves the appropriate content from its file system.
5. The web server sends the content back to the browser in the form of an HTTP response.
6. The browser receives the HTTP response and renders the content on the user's screen.
