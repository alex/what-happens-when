I tend to use the websites github.com and google.com. Sometimes when I type the key "g" and the domain "github.com" or "google.com"
is also displayed on the search bar in my browser. The letter "g" is not highlighted but the rest is highlighted in blue. I ave the
option to continue typing the rest of the word I want to search or leave it at that and hit "Enter".

If I want "google.com" and the word displayed is "google.com", I always hit enter and am directed to the Google HomePage. Else, I will continu
e typing the name of the website. Suggestions are given based on my history and the website whose domain is almost similar to the one I want.
IF the suggestion fits the website I want, I'll just hit "Enter". I will be directed to the website.
