#  What Happens When You Type google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter


_Ever wondered what transpires in the unseen yet fascinating virtual universe when you navigate to a desired site? Today, we’ll embark on an enlightening journey to unravel the mystery behind typing google.com into your browser.

On this adventure, we’ll encounter various entities as we traverse the vast digital forest, exploring the intricate workings of the internet._

## Introduction

__In this article, I aim to elucidate the behind-the-scenes process that unfolds when we visit a website. We’ll delve into the intricate procedure that transpires within milliseconds to deliver our desired webpages. When we input a link or URL into our browser, a fascinating sequence of events is set into motion. But before we delve into the details, let’s immerse ourselves in an ancient tale — a narrative of a tribe of renderers, servers, and all the elements in between.__

### The Tale of the Internet

Once upon a time, in a realm far beyond human comprehension, there existed a tribe of beings who lived to serve their master, a deity known as “The Great Navigator”. This Navigator periodically demanded a festival, a grand event that required the collaboration of all members of different clans within the Tribe.

Each time the Navigator appeared, he requested various types of festivals. Not all tribes understood his language or his intentions, except for the descendants of “The Compass Rose”. They interpreted his request, translated it into a code language comprehensible to all tribes, and passed it on to the next clan for execution.

The next clan to undertake the task were the descendants of “The Swift Courier”. They held the rules necessary to fulfill the Navigator’s wishes and were the only ones granted access to certain crucial elements of the festivals. These elements were so tightly guarded that their nature and location remain a mystery to this day.

The clan would then select a suitable member to venture out of their dwelling forest in pursuit of these crucial elements. On his journey, the chosen one would encounter the “Guardian Phoenix”, a protector known for safeguarding the forest from unwanted intrusions and preserving its customs and traditions.

Upon seeing a unique birthmark on the Courier’s neck, an indication of his permitted exit, the Phoenix would allow him to proceed on his mission to satisfy the master.

Just before embarking on his journey, the Courier would retrieve a “Magic Cloak” from his bag. This Cloak, the only known “Secret” of the couriers that is recognized outside the clan, served as a protective shield. It ensured the Courier remained unnoticed as he navigated through the wilderness, preventing him from being captured by the malicious trolls and serpents that lurked therein.

Guided by his map and the description provided by the “Compass Rose”, the Courier would journey for days until he encountered “The Juggler of Tasks”. The Juggler would explain that the requests in the description bounced between places, each known as “The Grand Library”. These places were indistinguishable to all but the Juggler himself, who would then direct the Courier to the current Grand Library housing his request.

Upon reaching the Grand Library, the Courier, using the description from the “Compass Rose”, would spend hours searching for his desired request. When he finally found it, his joy was short-lived as he discovered that the request had been torn and its crucial parts lost. Just when all hope seemed lost, he noticed a small door with a drawing of a paper bearing the inscription of the request and an opening seemingly designed for the request. Guided by instinct, the Courier inserted the paper into the opening, unknowingly discovering “The Enchanted Workshop”, a place few couriers ever experience in their lifetime. This Enchanted Workshop magically repaired all the torn and missing parts of the request.

The Enchanted Workshop, realizing that the request was too general and not specific to a particular festival, requested the detail given to the Courier by the “Compass Rose”, which he provided.

The Workshop then accessed its priceless possession, hidden from all creatures except the Workshop itself. She opened this possession, rumored to be “The Treasured Chest”, which contained treasures specific to each deity. These treasures, in the wrong hands, could bring down the deities that owned them and were coveted by the malicious trolls and serpents in the wilderness.

The Workshop integrated the treasure into the request, transforming it into the perfect festival submission for the great deity.

Upon his return, the Courier was celebrated as the latest hero and submitted his findings to the Storyteller, who then teleported it into “The Living Scroll”. Passing this request into the Scroll transformed it into something understandable by the deity, as they did not share languages. The deity reveled in the result presented to him by the Living Scroll, along with other parts of the festival, until it concluded.

The End

Did you enjoy this fairytale? If you’re still here reading with me, then you are one of the few deities that truly appreciate these diligent workers as they swiftly navigate this process to provide you with your website.

Now, let’s relate this story to what happens when we type “Google.com”.

Firstly, I’ll link each representation in the story to its counterpart in reality:

* User: “The Great Navigator”
* DNS Request: “The Compass Rose”
* TCP/IP: “The Swift Courier”
* Firewall: “The Dragon’s Shield”
* HTTPS/SSL: “The Magic Cloak”
* Load-balancer: “The Juggler of Tasks”
* Web Server: “The Grand Library”
* Application Server: “The Enchanted Workshop”
* Database: “The Treasure Chest”
* Browser: “The Living Scroll”

_So, how does this relate to real life?_ When the User (“The Great Navigator”) enters a URL (“The request for a festival”), the computer doesn’t understand this string of text (the URL). So, it turns to its DNS provider (“The Compass Rose”) to transform it into an IP address of the server housing the website. The URL then follows the TCP/IP, a protocol that determines the rules of transfer over IP addresses. The request then encounters the firewall, which protects the PC from unwanted entry and exit. However, it’s permitted as it’s recognized as a permitted exit, with the birthmark representing the port it passes through, which is an authorized space permitted through the firewall for entry and exit. The data transferred during this process is encrypted to prevent malicious actors from stealing private data, so they can’t use any of the data.

Then, the request finds its way to the Web Server containing the response or a load balancer if one is set up. Behind this load balancer (“The Juggler of Tasks”) are multiple web servers that are identical. Based on certain algorithms and instructions, it chooses one of them to return the response request. This is to avoid one web server from being overwhelmed in case of numerous simultaneous or separate requests, so it spreads the task among multiple similar servers that’ll react very similarly to the response (“The Great Libraries”).

After this, the application runs the actual applications on the application server if one is needed to perform the computation required by the request (“The Enchanted Workshop”). This transforms a static web page into something actually meaningful to the user. If needed, it then goes to the Database (“The Treasure Chest”) to fetch data unique to the user or sometimes general to further make it suitable for use.

Finally, this finished product is returned to the browser that requested it still encrypted and then is rendered by the browser (“The Living Scroll”) into a website understandable by the user from the rather not human understandable code.

Then we get to use the website and other internet-related resources like this.

This is the long process that occurs within milliseconds after we enter a URL into our browser to visit websites.

I hope after this we’ve been able to understand how websites are served to us and in the process enjoyed my little fairytale.
