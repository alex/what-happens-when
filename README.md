This files tells us what happens when......

When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press enter, a lot happens behind the scenes to display the Google homepage on your screen. Let's take a look at the different stages involved in the process.

DNS request:
The first thing that happens is your browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the IP address of "www.google.com" into an actual IP address that can be used to communicate with Google's servers. The DNS server will look up the IP address associated with the domain name and return it to your browser.

TCP/IP:
The next step is to establish a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is used to ensure that all data is reliably transmitted from the browser to the server. Once the TCP connection is established, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server asking for the Google homepage.

Firewall:
Before the request reaches the server, it may pass through a firewall. The firewall will check the request to ensure that it meets certain criteria before allowing it to proceed. This is done to protect the server from malicious requests and potential security breaches.

HTTPS/SSL:
Google uses HTTPS/SSL to encrypt the communication between your browser and their servers. HTTPS ensures that any information that is transmitted between your browser and the server is secure and cannot be intercepted by any third party. SSL certificates are used to verify the authenticity of the server and ensure that you are communicating with the real Google servers.

Load-balancer:
When your request reaches Google's servers, it may pass through a load-balancer. Load-balancers are used to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. This helps to ensure that the server can handle large amounts of traffic and reduces the risk of the server becoming overloaded.

Web server:
Once the request reaches the correct server, it is handled by a web server. The web server will take the HTTP request and return an HTML document that contains the Google homepage.

Application server:
In some cases, the web server may communicate with an application server to process the request. The application server may be used to execute code or access databases to retrieve data that is needed to build the response.

Database:
Finally, the web server may communicate with a database to retrieve data that is needed to generate the response. In the case of Google, the database may be used to store information about the search results that are displayed on the homepage.

In conclusion, typing "https://www.google.com" into your browser and pressing enter triggers a complex process that involves many different systems and protocols working together to deliver the Google homepage to your screen. Each of these stages is critical to ensuring that the communication between your browser and the server is secure and that the response is delivered quickly and efficiently.
