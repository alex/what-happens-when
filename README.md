Have you ever wondered what happens when you type "https://google.com" in your browser and press enter?

When you enter a URL into your browser and press Enter, several steps occur before you can access the website. First, the browser contacts a DNS resolver to obtain the IP address associated with the domain name. After the IP address is obtained, the browser uses the TCP/IP protocol to make a request to the server for the web pages or application stored at that IP address. The firewall filters incoming and outgoing requests to ensure only authorized traffic is allowed. Load balancing is used to coordinate the amount of load each server receives to reduce the risk of server failure and provide a faster response.

The web server receives the request from the load balancer, searches for the files, encrypts the data if the IP address has an SSL/TLS certificate, and sends the data back to the client. An application server provides an environment for running and managing web applications, receives and processes requests, generates a response, and sends it back to the load balancer. The load balancer forwards the response to the client that made the request, which decrypts, assembles, and displays it to the user.

Databases are essential for storing and managing data, providing a structured way to store and retrieve information for efficient processing and analysis. When a web or app server needs to retrieve information from a database, it establishes a connection using the server name, port number, database name, username, and password. The server interacts with the database by executing SQL queries to store or retrieve data.

In summary, accessing a website involves several steps, including DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, firewall filtering, load balancing, web server processing, application server handling, and database interaction. Each step plays a crucial role in ensuring the website is accessed safely and efficiently.
