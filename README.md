# There are some important steps missing from the previous explanation of the DNS lookup process. Here are two additional details to consider:

# 1. Root Servers:
After consulting the local cache and hosts file, if the DNS server still doesn't have the record, it needs to start at the top of the hierarchy. It sends a query to one of the 13 root servers, which only contain information about the Top-Level Domains (TLDs) like .com, .org, etc.

# 2. Delegation and TLD Servers:
The root server responds with the address of the relevant TLD server (e.g., for .com domains, the address of a Verisign server). The DNS server then contacts the TLD server, which points it to the authoritative nameserver for the specific domain (e.g., "google.com").

# Adding these details will paint a more complete picture of the intricate journey a DNS request takes across various servers and hierarchical levels before finally reaching the authoritative answer for the desired domain.
