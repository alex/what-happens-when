What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter.
DNS Request
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you type “https://www.google.com" into your browser, your computer needs to convert the human-readable domain name, “www.google.com," into an IP address, which is used to locate the web server.

2. TCP/IP

Once your computer has the IP address, it initiates a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) so as to establish a reliable connection for data transmission.

3. Firewall

At this point, the data passes through any firewalls that may be in place. Firewalls are network security devices that filter incoming and outgoing traffic to protect a network from unauthorized access or potential threats.

4. HTTPS/SSL

In the case of “https://www.google.com," the “https” in the URL indicates that the website uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). This protocol ensures that the data exchanged between your browser and the web server is encrypted.

5. Load-Balancer

Load balancers help ensure high availability and prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed with traffic. The load balancer redirects your request to an available web server.

6. Web Server

The web server is where the actual web page resides. When your request reaches the web server, it processes your request, retrieves the requested webpage, and sends it back to your browser

7. Application Server

Many websites, including Google, use application servers to generate dynamic content which processes your search query and retrieves relevant results from its massive database.

8. Database

A database stores the vast amount of data required to generate web pages. Your search query needs to be processed by the database server to provide you with relevant results.
