Title: Navigating the Web Stack: Unveiling the Journey of https://www.google.com

Introduction:
In the dynamic realm of Full-Stack Software Engineering, understanding the intricacies of web applications is paramount. One classic yet ever-relevant interview question often posed to candidates is, "What happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter?" This question delves into the foundational knowledge of how the web stack operates on the internet. In this blog post, we will embark on a comprehensive journey, dissecting each step in the process to unravel the magic behind this seemingly simple action.

DNS Request:
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you enter https://www.google.com, your browser needs to translate the human-readable domain name into an IP address. This process involves querying DNS servers to obtain the correct IP address associated with the domain. Without a successful DNS resolution, the subsequent steps in loading the webpage cannot take place (Fisher, 2022).

TCP/IP:
With the IP address in hand, the browser initiates a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data, while IP handles the addressing and routing. This step establishes a connection between the client (your browser) and the server hosting the requested webpage (Fisher, 2022).

Firewall:
In the context of security, firewalls play a crucial role. They act as barriers between your computer and the internet, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic. A firewall may examine the incoming TCP/IP packets to ensure they adhere to specified security rules before allowing or blocking them (Tanenbaum & Wetherall, 2010).

HTTPS/SSL:
Security is paramount in today's digital landscape. The next step involves the initiation of a secure connection using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. This ensures that the data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted, safeguarding against potential eavesdropping and tampering (Fielding & Reschke, 2014).

Load-Balancer:
In the world of high-traffic websites, load balancing becomes essential. Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck. This step enhances the performance, scalability, and reliability of web applications (Vijay & Sree, 2023).

Web Server:
With the connection established and security ensured, the web server comes into play. The web server's role is to handle incoming requests, retrieve the requested web page or resources, and send them back to the client. Popular web servers include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS (Severance, 2016).

Application Server:
For dynamic web applications, an application server is employed. This server executes application logic, retrieves, and updates data from databases, and generates dynamic content to be sent back to the web server. Technologies such as Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails exemplify the diverse landscape of application servers (Severance, 2016).

Database:
Behind the scenes, databases store and retrieve data, playing a pivotal role in web applications. Whether it's a relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL variant like MongoDB, the database ensures persistent and structured data storage (Pratt & Adamski, 2014).

Conclusion
Navigating the web stack is akin to a symphony, with each component playing a crucial role in delivering the seamless web experience we often take for granted. From the initial DNS request to the backend database operations, understanding this intricate dance empowers Full-Stack Software Engineers to build robust and scalable web applications. As we demystify the journey of typing https://www.google.com, let this knowledge serve as a foundation for navigating the vast and ever-evolving landscape of web development.
