The browser sends a request to the Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate the URL "www.google.com" to an IP address.

The DNS server responds with the IP address of the server that hosts Google's website.

The browser establishes a TCP connection with the server at that IP address on port 443 (the default port for HTTPS).

The browser and server perform a "handshake" to establish an encrypted connection using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server for the specific page or resource that was requested (in this case, the homepage).

The server processes the request and sends an HTTP response back to the browser.

The browser receives the response and renders the webpage for the user to view.

If the user interacts with the webpage (e.g. clicks a link or submits a form), the browser may send additional requests to the server to load new resources or perform actions on the user's behalf.

When the user is finished interacting with the webpage, they may close the browser or navigate to a different URL, which will start the process over again for the new request.
