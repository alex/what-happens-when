You may not think about it much, but when you type a URL like "https://www.google.com" into your browser's address bar and hit Enter,
a complex chain of events unfolds behind the scenes to ensure you reach your desired destination on the web. In this blog post, we'll
take a step-by-step journey through the process to understand what happens when you initiate this seemingly simple action.

1. DNS Request:
As soon as you hit Enter, your browser sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server to resolve "www.google.com" into
an IP address. Think of DNS as the internet's phone book, translating human-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.

2. TCP/IP:
With the IP address in hand, your browser uses the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite to establish a connection
with the server hosting the Google website. This suite ensures reliable data transmission between your computer and the remote server.

3. Firewall:
Before any data exchange can occur, your request may pass through a firewall, a security system that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic.
It checks for suspicious activity and can block or allow the request based on predefined rules.

4. HTTPS/SSL:
If Google uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), which it does, your browser and the server engage in an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) handshake.
This process encrypts the data exchanged between your computer and Google's servers, ensuring that your interactions are secure and private.

5. Load-Balancer:
Many large websites like Google employ load balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. This helps balance the traffic load, ensuring that
no single server gets overwhelmed. Load balancers enhance website reliability and performance.

6. Web Server:
Once your request reaches Google's server farm, it's directed to one of many web servers. These servers store and deliver web pages, serving as the initial contact
point between your browser and the Google infrastructure.

7. Application Server:
Behind the web servers, you'll find application servers. These servers handle more complex tasks, such as processing search queries, managing user accounts, and providing
personalized content.

8. Database:
To fetch the requested web page or search results, the application server may need to access a database. Google relies on vast databases to store its index of web pages and
user data, which the application server queries and retrieves information from.

In summary, when you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter, your request undergoes a journey involving DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, firewall checks,
HTTPS encryption, load balancing, web server interaction, application server processing, and database retrieval. All these steps work seamlessly together to provide you with a fast,
secure, and reliable web browsing experience. The next time you access a website, take a moment to appreciate the intricate dance of technology happening behind the scenes.
