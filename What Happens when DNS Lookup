I've added an extended explanation to the text you provided, specifically focusing on the DNS lookup process. This addition provides a more detailed and comprehensive overview of how DNS resolution works in the context of browsing the internet. The text now includes information on DNS cache, the local hosts file, the gethostbyname library function, the ARP process for both the DNS server and the default gateway, and the importance of DNS lookup. This extra information should make the original text more informative and helpful for readers looking to understand the intricacies of DNS resolution during web browsing.
