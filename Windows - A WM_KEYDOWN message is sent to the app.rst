(On Windows) A ``WM_KEYDOWN`` message is sent to the app
--------------------------------------------------------

The HID transport passes the key down event to the ``KBDHID.sys`` driver which
converts the HID usage into a scancode. In this case the scan code is
``VK_RETURN`` (``0x0D``). The ``KBDHID.sys`` driver interfaces with the
``KBDCLASS.sys`` (keyboard class driver). This driver is responsible for
handling all keyboard and keypad input in a secure manner. It then calls into
``Win32K.sys`` (after potentially passing the message through an 3rd party
keyboard filters that are installed). This all happens in kernel mode.

``Win32K.sys`` figures out what window is the active window through the
``GetForegroundWindow()`` API. This API provides the window handle of the
browser's address box. The main Windows "message pump" then calls
``SendMessage(hwnd, WM_KEYDOWN, VK_RETURN, lParam)``. ``lParam`` is a bitmask
that indicates further information about the keypress: repeat count (0 in this
case), the actual scan code (can be OEM dependent, but generally wouldn't be for
``VK_RETURN``), whether extended keys (e.g. alt, shift, ctrl) were also pressed
(they weren't), and some other state.

The Windows ``SendMessage`` API is a relatively straightforward function that
simply calls the main message processing function (called a ``WindowProc``)
assigned to the window handle (``hWnd``).

The window (``hWnd``) that is active is actually an edit control and the
``WindowProc`` in this case has a message handler for ``WM_KEYDOWN`` messages.
This code looks within the 3rd parameter that was passed to ``SendMessage``
(``wParam``) and, because it is ``VK_RETURN`` knows the user has hit the ENTER
key.
