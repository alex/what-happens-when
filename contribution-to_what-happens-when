When you type google.com into your browser's address bar and press Enter, several key web stack concepts come into play in the flow process. A complex series of actions take place, involving various components of the web stack .Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens:

    DNS (Domain Name System):

    Your browser first needs to translate the human-readable domain name, “google.com” into an IP address, which is required to locate the web server that hosts Google’s website.
    The browser sends a DNS request to a DNS resolver, typically provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a third-party DNS service like Google DNS.

2. TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):

    With the IP address of google.com is obtained from DNS, the browser uses TCP/IP to establish a connection to Google’s web server.
    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is responsible for reliable data transmission. It breaks data into packets and ensures that they are sent and received in the correct order.
    IP (Internet Protocol) is responsible for routing packets of data so they reach the correct destination across the internet.

3. Firewall:

    A firewall, either on your computer or within your network, may inspect outgoing and incoming traffic. It can block or allow requests based on predefined rules.
    In this case, the firewall may allow your browser to make an outbound connection to Google’s web server.

4. HTTPS/SSL (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/Secure Sockets Layer):

    When the browser initiates a connection to a web server, it defaults to using port 80 for HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or port 443 for HTTPS (HTTP Secure).
    For secure communication (HTTPS), the browser and the web server engage in an SSL/TLS handshake. This handshake typically takes place on port 443.
    Google’s website uses HTTPS to encrypt the data exchanged between the browser and their web server, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
    The browser requests an SSL/TLS handshake with the web server to establish a secure connection.

5. Load-Balancer:

    Large websites like Google employ load balancers to distribute incoming user requests efficiently across multiple web servers.
    Load balancers can use various algorithms to make routing decisions, such as round-robin, least connections, or IP hash.
    These decisions are based on factors like server health, response times, and server capacity to ensure optimal resource utilization.
    The load balancer often performs health checks on servers, directing traffic away from servers that are overloaded or experiencing issues.

6. Web Server:

After passing through the load balancer, your request reaches one of Google’s web servers.

    The web server (or multiple web servers) at Google’s end receives your request for google.com.
    It processes the request and generates the appropriate response, which typically includes fetching static contents like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources required to render the webpage.

7. Application Server:

    In many cases, especially for dynamic websites, an application server may be involved. This server runs server-side scripts or applications, such as PHP, Python, or Java, to generate dynamic content.
    The Google’s application server might handle running server-side code for search functionality or user account management, authentication, search queries, or other interactive features.

8. Database:

    For websites that rely on databases to store and retrieve information, a database server is used to manage the data.
    Google may access various databases to retrieve search results, user preferences, or other relevant information to display on the webpage.

9. Response and Rendering:

    After processing the request and gathering all necessary data, the web server and application server (if applicable) create an HTML response.
    The browser receives this response and renders the webpage, displaying it to the user on the screen.

In summary, when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter, the request goes through several layers of technology and infrastructure, including DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, firewall checks, secure encryption, load balancing, web and application servers, and database interactions, before you see the Google homepage on your browser. Each of these components plays a crucial role in delivering a seamless web browsing experience.
