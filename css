Time frame between request and response
---------------------------------------
The time frame between a request and a response can vary depending on the 
context and the specific systems involved. However, I'll provide a general 
overview of the typical process for a request and response in a 
web-based scenario.
The overall time frame between the request and response comprises several 
components, including network latency, server processing time, and 
client-side processing time. It can range from a few milliseconds for simple 
requests with low network latency to several seconds or more for complex 
requests or situations with high network congestion.
