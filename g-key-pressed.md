The "g" key is pressed
When you press the "g" key on your physical keyboard, the following actions occur:

Physical Keyboard Actions: The keyboard sends an interrupt to the operating system (OS) notifying it that a key has been pressed. The interrupt includes the keycode for the "g" key.

OS Interrupts: The OS receives the interrupt, checks the keycode, and determines that the "g" key was pressed. It then generates a corresponding event and sends it to the active application, in this case, the web browser.

Browser Event: The web browser receives the event and triggers its auto-complete functions. Depending on the browser's algorithm and whether you are in private/incognito mode or not, various suggestions will be presented to you in the dropdown below the URL bar. Most browsers sort and prioritize results based on search history, bookmarks, cookies, and popular searches from the internet.

Code Execution: As you continue typing "google.com", several blocks of code run concurrently. These blocks of code handle tasks such as:

Checking the spelling of each keystroke
Comparing the entered text to the browser's history and bookmarks
Sorting and prioritizing suggestions based on various factors
Updating the suggestions dropdown with each keystroke
Matching the text to available URLs and domains
Suggestions: As you type, the suggestions will be refined with each keypress. For example, if you type "g", the browser may suggest "Google", "Gmail", or "GitHub". If you continue typing "o", the browser may refine these suggestions to "Google.com", "Google.ca", or "Google.co.uk".

Auto-Complete: Depending on the browser's settings and your keystrokes, the browser may even suggest and auto-complete "google.com" before you finish typing it.

Remember that the specifics of these actions and behaviors may vary between different browsers and operating systems. However, the overall process is similar in most cases.
