html parsing

When a web page is requested by a user, and the application server searches from the
database, it sends back to the browser what finds as an html document. This document becomes the 
layout, the structure of the page.
The web browser parses the html document to display to the user. When this happens,a DOM
is created. It is presented in a hierarchical form with each component of the html page 
represented as node in a tree. The browser applies CSS to the elements in a tree to 
enhance the visual look.
Usually, JavaScript is used to parse html pages by web browsers.The DOM allows you to manipulate the
parsed elements.Other languages like python can be used as well to parse web pages
