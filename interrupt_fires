In the realm of keyboard input, the initiation of an interrupt is a pivotal moment in the journey from hardware to software interaction. Here's a more detailed exploration of how this process unfolds, particularly for non-USB keyboards:
### IRQ Assignments:
In the intricacies of hardware functionalities, each device, including the keyboard, is assigned a specific Interrupt Request (IRQ) by the system. For non-USB keyboards, the IRQ assignment plays a crucial role in facilitating the communication between the keyboard and the system.
### Legacy PS/2 Communication:
Notably, PS/2 keyboards, a classic variant in this context, communicate through a specific IRQ â€“ usually IRQ 1. The interrupt signals generated by the keyboard are directed to this interrupt line, marking the beginning of the interaction with the system.
### Interrupt Priority:
Understanding the concept of interrupt priority adds another layer to this process. In systems with multiple devices triggering interrupts, the interrupt controller prioritizes them based on their assigned IRQs. Generally, lower-numbered IRQs are associated with higher priority.
### Interrupt Handling Process:
As the keyboard sends signals, the interrupt controller swiftly maps these to the corresponding IRQ. The CPU, in turn, references the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), a vital lookup table mapping interrupt vectors to kernel-supplied interrupt handlers. The selected interrupt handler is then executed, marking the entry into the kernel.
### Kernel Mode Transition:
The transition into the kernel is significant, signifying a shift into kernel mode. This mode allows the operating system to execute privileged instructions and manage the interrupt in a controlled and secure environment.
### Interrupt Latency:
Optionally, consider the concept of interrupt latency. This denotes the time delay between the occurrence of an interrupt and the initiation of the corresponding interrupt handler. Minimizing interrupt latency is imperative for sustaining system responsiveness.
These intricacies of hardware signals, IRQ assignments, and kernel interactions forms the foundation of keyboard input handling, offering a glimpse into how it enables seamless communication between the user and the operating system.
