The "g" key is pressed
The following sections provide insights into the physical keyboard actions and OS interrupts triggered by pressing the "g" key. When this key is pressed, the browser processes the event, initiating auto-complete functions. The suggestions in the dropdown below the URL bar are influenced by various factors, including the browser's algorithm, browsing mode (private/incognito), and user-specific data such as search history, bookmarks, cookies, and popular internet searches.

As you type "google.com," numerous code blocks execute, continuously refining suggestions with each keypress. Notably, the algorithm may even predict and suggest "google.com" before you complete typing it, enhancing the user experience.

The "enter" key bottoms out
Let's delve into the specific details when the "enter" key is pressed and reaches the bottom of its range. At this point, an electrical circuit dedicated to the "enter" key is closed, allowing a controlled current flow into the keyboard's logic circuitry. This circuitry scans the state of each key switch, employing debouncing to filter electrical noise generated by the switch's rapid intermittent closure.

The resulting keycode, often represented as an integer (e.g., 13 for the "enter" key), is then encoded by the keyboard controller. This keycode is subsequently transmitted to the computer, a process that has evolved over time from historical PS/2 and ADB connections to modern USB or Bluetooth connections.

In the case of the USB keyboard:
The USB circuitry of the keyboard is powered by the 5V supply from the computer's USB host controller (pin 1).
The generated keycode is stored in the keyboard circuitry's internal memory, specifically in a register referred to as "endpoint."
The host USB controller polls this "endpoint" approximately every 10 milliseconds, retrieving the stored keycode value.
The keycode is then sent to the USB SIE (Serial Interface Engine) for conversion into one or more USB packets adhering to the low-level USB protocol.
These packets are transmitted through a differential electrical signal over the D+ and D- pins at a maximum speed of 1.5 Mb/s, adhering to the "low-speed device" designation for USB 2.0 compliance.
The host USB controller on the computer decodes this serial signal, and the interpreted keycode is passed to the computer's Human Interface Device (HID) universal keyboard device driver.
Subsequently, the value of the key is handed over to the operating system's hardware abstraction layer.
In the case of Virtual Keyboard (as in touch screen devices):
When a user places their finger on a modern capacitive touch screen, a small current is transferred to the finger, completing the circuit through the electrostatic field of the conductive layer.
The screen controller then raises an interrupt, reporting the coordinates of the keypress.
The mobile OS notifies the currently focused application of a press event in one of its GUI elements, typically corresponding to virtual keyboard application buttons.
The virtual keyboard, in turn, raises a software interrupt to signal a 'key pressed' message back to the OS.
This interrupt notifies the currently focused application of a 'key pressed' event.
Interrupt fires [NOT for USB keyboards]
In the context of interrupts, the keyboard sends signals on its interrupt request line (IRQ). These signals are mapped to an interrupt vector (integer) by the interrupt controller. The CPU utilizes the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) to map the interrupt vectors to functions (interrupt handlers) supplied by the kernel. Upon the arrival of an interrupt, the CPU indexes the IDT, leading to the invocation of the appropriate handler and entry into the kernel.

(On Windows) A WM_KEYDOWN message is sent to the app
On Windows, a specific sequence unfolds:

A WM_KEYDOWN message is dispatched to the application.
The HID transport channels the key-down event to the KBDHID.sys driver, responsible for translating HID usage into a scancode (e.g., VK_RETURN).
KBDHID.sys interfaces with the KBDCLASS.sys driver, a secure handler for keyboard and keypad input in kernel mode.
The process involves interaction with Win32K.sys, and potentially third-party keyboard filters installed in the system.
The active window, identified using the GetForegroundWindow() API, receives a SendMessage(hWnd, WM_KEYDOWN, VK_RETURN, lParam) call.
The lParam bitmask contains information about the keypress, such as repeat count and scan code.
The SendMessage API queues the message for the particular window handle (hWnd).
The WindowProc assigned to hWnd processes each message in the queue, identifying that the user has hit the ENTER key.
(On OS X) A KeyDown NSEvent is sent to the app
In the macOS environment:

An interrupt signal triggers an event in the I/O Kit kext keyboard driver.
This driver translates the signal into a key code, subsequently passed to the OS X WindowServer process.
The WindowServer dispatches an event to relevant applications via their Mach port.
Handling this event involves an NSApplication main event loop and an NSEvent of NSEventType KeyDown.
(On GNU/Linux) the Xorg server listens for keycodes
In a GNU/Linux setting:

The graphical X server utilizes the generic event driver evdev to capture the keypress.
Keycode-to-scancode remapping occurs based on X server-specific keymaps and rules.
The X server then sends the character to the window manager, which forwards it to the focused window in the graphical API.
Parse URL
When parsing a URL, the browser performs several critical steps:

Protocol Recognition:

The browser identifies the protocol in the URL (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).
Hostname Extraction:

The hostname (e.g., www.example.com) is extracted from the URL.
Port Determination:

If a port is specified in the URL, it takes precedence; otherwise, default ports (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS) are assumed.
Path Parsing:

The path portion of the URL is parsed, identifying the specific resource on the server.
Query String and Fragment Handling:

Any query string (e.g., ?key1=value1&key2=value2) and fragment identifier (e.g., #section1) are parsed for further processing.
Internationalization and Encoding:

Non-ASCII Unicode characters in the URL are encoded according to the Punycode standard (for internationalized domain names).
HSTS List Check:

The browser checks its HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) list to determine if the site should be accessed via a secure (HTTPS) connection.
HTTP protocol
When the web browser initiates an HTTP request to retrieve a page:

DNS Resolution:

The browser resolves the hostname to an IP address via DNS resolution.
TCP Handshake:

A TCP connection is established between the browser and the server through a three-way handshake.
HTTP Request:

The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, including the necessary headers and information about the requested resource.
Server Processing:

The server processes the request, retrieves the requested resource, and generates an HTTP response.
TCP Closure:

The server sends the HTTP response to the browser over the established TCP connection.
HTTP Response:

The browser receives and interprets the HTTP response, handling status codes, headers, and the response body.
Google Chrome-specific behavior
If the web browser is developed by Google (e.g., Google Chrome), it may exhibit unique behaviors. Instead of sending a standard HTTP request to retrieve the page, Google Chrome may negotiate with the server for an "upgrade" to the SPDY protocol. SPDY is a deprecated protocol developed by Google to reduce page load times through features like multiplexing and header compression.

Rendering Process
The rendering process involves several stages:

Document Object Model (DOM) Construction:

The browser parses the HTML response and constructs the DOM, representing the structure of the web page.
CSS Styling:

The browser applies CSS styles to the elements in the DOM, determining their visual presentation.
Layout:

The browser calculates the layout of the elements, considering factors like size, position, and spacing.
Paint:

The browser paints the elements onto the screen, creating the visual representation of the web page.
Composite:

The final layer positions are computed, and composite commands are issued via graphics APIs like Direct3D or OpenGL.
Window Server
Post-rendering processes involve interactions with the Window Server or display server:

Window Composition:

The Window Server combines the rendered content from different applications into a cohesive display.
User-Induced Execution:

User interactions, such as mouse clicks or keyboard input, trigger execution of corresponding functions in the application code.
JavaScript Execution:

If the web page includes JavaScript code, it is executed, allowing dynamic modifications to the page's content and behavior.
Plugin Execution:

Browser plugins (e.g., Flash, Java) may be executed to handle specific content types or enhance functionality.
Post-rendering and User-Induced Execution
Following the rendering process, user interactions play a crucial role:

Event Handling:

User actions, such as clicks or keyboard input, generate events that are handled by the application.
JavaScript Execution:

If the web page contains JavaScript code, it is executed in response to user interactions, enabling dynamic updates and interactions.
DOM Manipulation:

JavaScript can manipulate the DOM, changing the structure and content of the rendered page.
Asynchronous Requests:

JavaScript can initiate asynchronous requests to the server (e.g., AJAX), fetching additional data without reloading the entire page.
User Interface Updates:

The browser updates the user interface based on user interactions and the execution of JavaScript code, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience.
By enhancing and expanding on these sections, the document becomes more comprehensive, providing a detailed understanding of the intricate processes involved when a key is pressed, a URL is parsed, and a web page is rendered and executed.
