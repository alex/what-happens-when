This is basically what was in the diagram in task 1.
DNS request: When you type the URL in your browser, a DNS (Domain Name System) request is made to translate the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address.

TCP/IP: Once the IP address is obtained, a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection is established between your computer and the web server hosting the website.

Firewall: The connection passes through any firewalls or security measures implemented to protect the server and network.

HTTPS/SSL: If the website uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), a secure SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) handshake occurs to establish an encrypted connection between your browser and the web server.

Load-balancer: In some cases, a load balancer may distribute the incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure efficient handling of requests.

Web server: The web server receives the request, processes it, and generates a response.

Application server: In more complex applications, an application server may handle the dynamic processing and logic of the request.

Database: If the request requires data from a database, the application server interacts with the database server to retrieve the necessary information.
