The hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)
After the web server is found, the server sends an acknowledgement to your computer (the client). The acknowledgement sent by the server hosting the website you want to visit also has a secure service layer (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS) certificate that provides the web browser in your computer with a public encryption key. The web browser uses the public key to encrypt all information it sends to the remote web server hosting “google.com”. The remote server also uses the public key to encrypt the responses it sends to your web browser about “google.com”. This encrypted communication shows as a “padlock” sign in the address bar of your web browser. If the connection between the remote web server and your computer is not secure, the address bar displays an exclamation sign indicating that the connection is ‘not secure’. The hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the set of rules and standards that encrypts information shared by the remote web server and your computer. In the case of your request to visit “google.com”, your address bar will read “https//www.google.com” (the secure version of the URL).
