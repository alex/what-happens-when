The internet is indeed a remarkable invention that has transformed the world in ways unimaginable just a few decades ago. With the advent of the internet, we have access to an infinite amount of information at our fingertips, and the speed at which we can retrieve that information is astounding.

When we type in a request into the search bar of our favorite browser, a series of exchanges occur within a split second that ultimately results in the delivery of the requested information. This process involves a complex network of interconnected devices, protocols, and systems that work together to ensure that data is transmitted quickly and accurately.

The speed at which data is transmitted over the internet is also influenced by factors such as bandwidth, latency, and congestion. Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a connection at a given time, while latency refers to the delay between sending a request and receiving a response. Congestion, on the other hand, occurs when there is too much traffic on a network, resulting in slower data transmission speeds.

To elaborate, here is typically what happens when you type in a website and press enter:

DNS request: The first step is for your browser to send a Domain Name System (DNS) request to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or another DNS resolver. The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.google.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device — like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (google.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the google.com webpage.
TCP/IP: Once the DNS resolver provides an IP address, your browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) connection with the web server at that IP address. TCP/IP is the protocol used to exchange data over the internet.
Firewall: Next, the connection passes through a firewall, which is a security system designed to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic. The firewall checks if the incoming traffic is safe and if it is authorized to access the server.
HTTPS/SSL: If the firewall allows the connection, the browser initiates a secure HTTPS connection with the web server. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an encrypted version of HTTP that ensures secure communication between the browser and the web server. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), is the protocol that provides the encryption and decryption of the data sent over the HTTPS connection.
Load-balancer: If the website you are trying to access is hosted on a large scale, it may use a load-balancer, which is a device that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. The load-balancer ensures that the traffic is evenly distributed, which improves website performance and prevents any one server from being overwhelmed.
Web server: Once the HTTPS connection is established, the web server receives the request from the browser and returns the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the website. The web server is responsible for hosting the website and responding to requests from clients. It retrieves the requested resources, generates a response, and sends it back to the client over the established HTTPS connection.
Application server: The web server may pass the request to an application server if the website requires dynamic content, such as e-commerce sites. The application server generates dynamic content by querying databases and performing other business logic, and then sends the generated content back to the web server.
Database: Finally, the web server retrieves any necessary data from the database to generate the response. The database stores the website’s data, such as user profiles, product information, and other relevant information.

Internet Networking
In conclusion, when you type “https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter, a series of steps occur that involve DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load-balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. Understanding the web stack workflow is crucial for software engineers and web developers, as it allows them to optimize website performance, ensure security, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
