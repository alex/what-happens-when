Demystifying the Journey of a Web Request: Exploring the Path of Typing "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser
Introduction: 
Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter? It's an interesting journey with many important parts that all come together perfectly. We'll go into the details of this procedure in this blog post, illuminating the main participants and the actions they take to deliver the Google search page to you.
DNS Request:
 As soon as you hit Enter, your browser initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) request. The DNS converts the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address, serving as the internet's equivalent of a phone book. Your computer sends the request to DNS servers, which find the IP address linked to the domain name.
TCP/IP: 
With the IP address in hand, your browser now establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the web server hosting Google. TCP breaks down the data into packets and ensures reliable delivery by managing acknowledgments and retransmissions. Internet Protocol (IP) comes into play, routing the packets across the internet to reach the destination.
Firewall: At this stage, a firewall might come into play. Firewalls act as gatekeepers, monitoring and filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic to protect against unauthorized access. They ensure that only legitimate traffic passes through while blocking potentially harmful or malicious requests.
HTTPS/SSL: Next, the browser and web server engage in a secure handshake using the HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol. HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between your browser and the web server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificate validates the authenticity of the web server, establishing a secure connection.
Load Balancer: When dealing with high-traffic websites like Google, load balancers come into play. Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to optimize performance and prevent overload. They ensure that your request reaches an available server in the most efficient manner, enhancing responsiveness and scalability.
Web Server: 
Your request is routed through a load balancer before arriving at one of Google's web servers. It is the responsibility of the web server to process the HTTP request, get the desired webpage, and then package it in an HTTP response. It might handle dynamic content, work with databases, or dynamically create portions of the website.
Application Server:
 In some cases, the web server may pass the request to an application server. Application servers are responsible for executing business logic, processing requests, and generating dynamic content. They may interact with databases, perform calculations, or handle complex operations before returning a response to the web server.
Database: 
If the requested webpage relies on data stored in a database, the application server queries the database to retrieve the required information. Databases are used to store, organize, and manage vast amounts of data, ensuring efficient retrieval and storage.
Conclusion: 
The journey of a web request from typing "https://www.google.com" to receiving the Google search page involves a complex interplay of various components. From DNS resolution to TCP/IP connections, firewalls to load balancers, web servers to application servers, and databases, each component plays a vital role in delivering the web content you seek. Understanding this process not only deepens our appreciation for the technical infrastructure supporting the internet but also provides insight into the layers of complexity.
