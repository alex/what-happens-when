Overview:
As we browse the internet, we often take for granted the intricate processes that occur behind the scenes when we enter a URL into our browser. In this blog post, we will embark on a journey to uncover the steps involved when typing "https://www.google.com" and pressing Enter. We will explore each stage, from the initial DNS request to the final database interaction. So, let's dive in and understand the fascinating web stack that powers our internet experience.

DNS Request:
The journey begins with the Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser, the browser extracts the domain name "www.google.com." It then sends a DNS request to a DNS resolver, usually provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a public DNS service like Google DNS. The resolver's task is to translate the human-readable domain name into an IP address.

TCP/IP:
Once the DNS resolver returns the IP address for "www.google.com," the browser initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. TCP is responsible for reliable data transmission over the internet. Through a three-way handshake, the browser and the server establish a connection, ensuring data integrity.

Firewall:
During the TCP handshake, the connection passes through firewalls, which act as a security barrier. Firewalls monitor and filter network traffic, protecting against unauthorized access and potential threats. If the connection meets the firewall's criteria, it allows the request to proceed.

HTTPS/SSL:
The next crucial step is securing the communication between the browser and the server. Google, like many reputable websites, employs HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to encrypt the data transmitted. HTTPS relies on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). The server presents a digital certificate to the browser, verifying its authenticity, and establishing an encrypted connection.

Load-balancer:
In order to handle high volumes of traffic and distribute it across multiple servers, websites often employ load-balancers. Load-balancers act as intermediaries between the user's browser and the web server cluster. They intelligently distribute incoming requests to optimize performance and prevent overloading any single server.

Web Server:
Once the request reaches a web server, it processes the HTTP request received from the browser. The web server software, such as Apache or Nginx, retrieves the requested resource, in this case, the homepage of "www.google.com." It generates an HTTP response containing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets required to render the page.

Application Server:
For complex web applications, an application server often comes into play. The application server runs the server-side code, processes business logic, and interacts with databases or external services. In the case of Google, the details of their specific architecture are closely guarded, but we can assume they employ application servers to handle dynamic content generation and other advanced functionalities.

Database:
Behind every data-driven website lies a database. When the application server requires data, it interacts with the database management system (DBMS). The DBMS retrieves, manipulates, and stores the requested data. In Google's case, their database infrastructure is incredibly complex, designed to handle the vast amounts of information they process every day.

Conclusion:
The process of entering "https://www.google.com" and hitting Enter triggers a cascade of intricate steps, unveiling the remarkable coordination of the web stack. From the initial DNS request to the ultimate database interaction, every component works harmoniously to deliver the desired web page to your browser. Grasping the intricacies of this journey is crucial for software engineers, empowering them to construct resilient and high-performing web applications. With a deep understanding of these underlying mechanisms, developers can craft immersive digital experiences and cater to the ever-evolving demands of the internet landscape.
