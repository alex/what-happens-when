# What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser and Press Enter

When you type a URL like "https://www.google.com" in your browser's address bar and hit Enter, a complex series of events unfolds behind the scenes to bring the Google homepage to your screen. In this blog post, we'll break down the process step by step, covering key components of the web stack.

## DNS Request
When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser, the journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. The first step is for your browser to translate the human-readable domain "www.google.com" into an IP address, a unique numerical identifier for a server on the internet. The DNS server performs this translation, looks up the IP address associated with the requested domain name and returns it to your browser.

## TCP/IP
Once your browser has obtained the IP address of "www.google.com," it establishes a connection to the Google server using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures reliable, error-checked communication between your browser and Google's server by dividing the data into packets and reassembling them at the destination.

## Firewall

The request passes through your local firewall, a crucial security measure. Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security policies and rules. These policies can specify which types of traffic are allowed or denied based on factors like port numbers, protocols, and IP addresses. the firewall checks the authorization of your specific request before allowing it. They play a vital role in preventing unauthorized access and protecting your system from potential threats.

Similarly, if the server you are trying to access is also protected by a firewall, a similar verification process takes place on the server side before the TCP connection is established, the server's firewall may inspect the incoming request to ensure it complies with the server's security policies. The firewall protects the server from unauthorized access and potential security threats.

## HTTPS/SSL

As the connection is established, your browser initiates an HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) request to communicate securely with the server. HTTPS uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data exchanged between the browser and the server. This ensures the privacy and integrity of the communication and that the data exchanged between your browser and the server is encrypted, safeguarding it from potential eavesdroppers.

## Load-Balancer

Google, being a massive service, likely employs load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. Load balancers ensure efficient resource utilization, enhance fault tolerance, optimize response times and ensures that the workload is evenly distributed among the available servers.

## Web Server

Upon reaching the designated server, the browser's request is processed by a web server. The web server handles static content, like HTML and images, responding to the browser's request by providing the initial components required for the Google homepage.
Once the the browser's request reaches the appropriate server, it is processed by a web server. The web server receives the request, interprets it, and generates a response. The web server handles static content, like HTML and images, responding to the browser's request by providing the initial components required for the Google homepage such as retrieving search results or serving other content.

## Application Server

In more complex web applications, there may be an additional layer called the application server. For dynamic content or user-specific interactions, the web server forwards the request to an application server. This server executes application logic, generating dynamic content tailored to the user or handling more complex tasks beyond the capabilities of a simple web server such as processing user authentication or interacting with databases.

## Database

If the requested information requires data retrieval or storage, the application server may interact with a database. The database holds information like user preferences, search history, or any data relevant to the services offered by the website. In Google's case, there may be a database that stores indexed web pages or other relevant information.

In conclusion, the seemingly simple act of typing "https://www.google.com" initiates a sophisticated orchestration of technologies, protocols, and servers. Each component plays a crucial role in delivering the seamless and secure user experience we've come to expect from modern websites.

This exploration highlights the intricate nature of the web stack, demonstrating the interplay of DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases.
